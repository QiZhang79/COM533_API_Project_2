# COM533_API_Project_2
This project is to develop a single-page site that is progressively enhanced with JavaScript 
and that responds to user input to pull in data from an open JSON API that does not require 
authorization.

## Project Goals
1. Understand and execute progressively enhanced, unobtrusive and asynchronous JavaScript
2. Work with an open API, learning how to hit its endpoints in response to user input
3. Process JSON-formatted data and present it in valid well-formed semantic HTML, styled with CSS
