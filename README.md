# COM533_API_Project_2
This project is to develop a single-page site that is progressively enhanced with JavaScript 
and that responds to user input to pull in data from an open JSON API that does not require 
authorization.

## Project Goals
1. Understand and execute progressively enhanced, unobtrusive and asynchronous JavaScript
2. Work with an open API, learning how to hit its endpoints in response to user input
3. Process JSON-formatted data and present it in valid well-formed semantic HTML, styled with CSS

## Origin Source
CityBikes API Documentation http://api.citybik.es/v2/#net_resource

## Application Features
1. Find whether there is public city bike service in your city;
2. Find how many slots and bikes in a specific station.

## What I will improve in the future
1. I haven't find a good way to make the country input matches JSON's country code. So I'll improve this later;
2. I will add a remind feature for input. When users are typing, the similar result will jump to a list.
